    | We'll be using YUI Test for our exercises, so have a quick read of the 'Test Cases' section on the YUI Test "Getting Started" page to get a better idea for how the tests are set up. Don't worry about the rest of the page, we'll get to those concepts later.

    | For our exercise, we'll be taking the concept behind and four-year old blog post and updating it to run in Node.JS. Skim through the article to get a better idea of what we'll be doing (we'll come back to it in the exercise).

block assignment
  p
    | We'll start the assignment by basically recreating what was done in the video. Then you'll see if you can complete the rest of the tests described in the article on your own.
  ul
    li Get your own workspace up and running
    li Install YUITest via NPM
    li Recreate the first tests talked about in the video
    li Run those tests from terminal and confirm they fail
    li Add the functionality described in the video to get the first test to pass
    li *Bonus* Complete the tests described in the "Test Driven Example" article
