  | Working with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model">DOM</a> means dealing with asynchronous actions and simulated events

    | The DOM, it's what makes TDD in JavaScript difficult.
  p
    | With most Test-Driven Development, you're simply testing values returned from functions. But what happens when those functions change the DOM? Also, how do you test user interaction (e.g. mouse clicks, keyboard events, etc)?
  p
    | Luckily, there is hope. YUI Test provides an Event Simulation component that helps test this type of functionality. Read through the YUI documentation for more information on how to use it.

    | Sometimes DOM interactions take time to run their course. So how do we get our tests to wait for our actions to run their course? By telling them to "wait()". Read the section linked below on Asynchronous tests for more information.

    | In Cloud9, create a new workspace by cloning <a href="https://github.com/klamping/Spoilr">this repository</a>, and then write code to make the included tests pass.
  p
    | Run your tests by opening 'spoilr.html' and 'previewing' it. The results should show in a YUI Console that get's loaded on the page.

    | Ignore the 'spoilr-node-solution.js' file for now. That will be covered in tomorrow's exercise.
