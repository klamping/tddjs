    | Getting tests to pass is one thing, but we also need to make sure our tests make sense. Read the following blog post for why they way you write your assertions matters

    | Knowing how assertions are built is a great way to improve your understanding of just what's going in. Review the following YUI 3 Gallery Module to get a better idea of what writing your own assertion looks like.

block assignment
  p
    | It's time to be a little more creative. In today's assignment, you're going to create your own assertions.
  ul
    li Create a new workspace
    li Install YUI Test
    li Create two new assertions (you decide what they do) by writing a function that uses an existing YUI assertion in a specific way
    li Be sure to include helpful error text
    li Finally, use that assertion in a couple of tests (you decide what you're testing)
